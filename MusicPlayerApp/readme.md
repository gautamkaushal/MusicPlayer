App
- Console app
- consumes SQLite *.db file to simulate a Music Player (can be generated by running SongsDataLoader solution)
- At high level, it prompts the user to choose a genre and then randomly play songs from that genre
- As user updates their preferences/ratings and as the session time progresses the kind of songs it chooses changes

To run
- ensure the Songs.db file is stored locally and path is configured as the connection string //Data Project folder can be used for it
- also, ensure the following are configured
    - User, //UserId, Ensure the User is configured in the DB
    - songs Page_size, //page size of the songs data to be retrieved. 
    - max_Playlist_size //Number of songs retrieved at any given moment of time
